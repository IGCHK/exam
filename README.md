# IGC HK Exam - WJEC

IGC HK Exam - WJEC is a subsidiary of IGC HK Exam, previously known as IGC Exam Website. Our instructor has more than 300+ hours of learning experience and over 100+ hours of developing course content-related materials. This website primarily focuses on WJEC (Welsh Joint Education Committee) and Eduqas (Education Qualification), which are located in Wales and England, respectively.

## Key Differences

Both WJEC and Eduqas have very similar specifications, with the primary difference being that Eduqas assesses its candidates in their second year, while WJEC has an AS exam for units 1 and 2, and A2 exams for units 3, 4, and 5. In other words, Eduqas might have mixed some A2 content into an AS paper, so please be careful when doing papers from Eduqas.
