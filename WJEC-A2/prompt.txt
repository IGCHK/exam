So I want you to create a website html which is use to view the file, I have stored the pdf into url which is in format of 
https://file.igchkshop.dpdns.org/WJEC-A2/Biology/Eduqas%20Component%202/2018/s18-biology-c2-qp.pdf

There is multiple part let me break down
1. Domain: https://file.igchkshop.dpdns.org/WJEC-A2 <- This is fixed
2. Then it is "Biology" <- This is the subject, there is 4 subject, Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Mathematics
3. Then file name of "Eduqas%20Component%202" <- The %20 means space, so the actual file name is "Eduqas Component 2" so there is 6 files in each subject which is 1. WJEC Unit 3 2. WJEC Unit 4 3. WJEC Unit 5 and 4. Eduqas Component 1 5. Eduqas Component 2 6. Eduqas Component 3
4. Then is the year "2018" <- There are 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024
5. Then it is actual file which is in format of "s18-biology-c2-qp.pdf" <- s is always same, 18 means year, biology is the subject (there is only one thing to note for the mathematics file, it would be shortened to maths so for a WJEC 2019 Unit 3 Question paper is https://file.igchkshop.dpdns.org/WJEC-A2/Mathematics/WJEC%20Maths%20Unit%203/2019/s19-maths-u3-qp.pdf) and lastly there is question paper which is shortened to qp before .pdf, mark scheme which is shortened to ms.pdf and practical paper which is shortened to p.pdf


I want you to create a WJEC like webpage titled, "IGC HK Exam - WJEC Past Paper Viewer" which can have dropbox for user to click in different paper. Let me give you an example, dont make it exactly the same but you can use a similar layout whcih can be seen in the page https://www.wjec.co.uk/qualifications/physics-asa-level/#tab_pastpapers


Great, I want a few things to be amended, 
1. Maths only have file of WJEC Unit 3 and 4, and only has year 2018, 2019, 2022, 2023, 2024
2. Only WJEC Unit 5 has practical paper
3. Physics, Chemistry and Biology dont have WJEC paper of all unit 3,4,5 for the year 2020 and 2021, but eduqas still has
4. Lastly, can the title match the colour of the light yellow whihc is in background instead of the dark blue colour

Ok so i want you to change 3 things
1. When the user just click in the page, remove the preset pdf and make it empty with just the dropbox for user to click, so no pdf preset shown
2. Also where is the practical paper for WJEC Unit 5, the practical paper ends with p.pdf
3. I also want the Last Dropbox be showing "Question Paper" instead of qp and "Mark Scheme" instead of ms

Also, there is some bug with the PDF viewer start empty, I think you can make a button "Enter" so that when user clicks it it will start showing because right now I can view the 1st file which is phyiscs 2017 unit 3 question paper
